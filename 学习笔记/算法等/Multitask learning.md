# 随手记

## MTL 特点
- 
- a model must leverage commonalities in the tasks (positive transfer) while minimizing interference (negative transfer).


## 特点

### Learning to Branch for Multi-Task Learning Pengsheng

#### 优点
- reduced latency(especially portable device)
- potentially improving generalization

typical CNN learns hierarchical natural of the feature representations

#### 缺点
- Over-sharing a network could erroneously enforce over-generalization, causing negative knowledge transfer across tasks

## ROUTING NETWORKS: ADAPTIVE SELECTION OF NON-LINEAR FUNCTIONS FOR MULTI-TASK LEARNING

### 定义
To address this issue we introduce the routing network paradigm, a novel neural network and training algorithm. A routing network is a kind of self-organizing neural network consisting of two components: a router and a set of one or more function blocks.
