[An Overview of Multi-Task Learning in Deep Neural Networks](https://ruder.io/multi-task/)

## 特点

### Learning to Branch for Multi-Task Learning Pengsheng

#### 优点
- reduced latency(especially portable device)
- potentially improving generalization

typical CNN learns hierarchical natural of the feature representations

#### 缺点
- Over-sharing a network could erroneously enforce over-generalization, causing negative knowledge transfer across tasks
