## 定义
> In computer science, a tree is a widely used abstract data type that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes.

### height depth
> The height of a node is the length of the longest downward path to a leaf from that node. The height of the root is the height of the tree. The depth of a node is the length of the path to its root (i.e., its root path).
>* 深度：对于任意节点n,n的深度为从根到n的唯一路径长，根的深度为0；
>* 高度：对于任意节点n,n的高度为从n到一片树叶的最长路径长，所有树叶的高度为0；
